## Supreme Ticket Monitor
Hello, I am [Rock](https://www.twitter.com/rockkdev) from the team at [StormeIO](https://www.twitter.com/stormeio) and I have decided to open-source a simple project of mine. It scans and waits for any changes on Supreme's website's scripts. Any script that changes or is added/removed will be sent to a webhook provided in the *config.json* file. I kindly ask you to not steal the code and rebrand it, at minimum keep the footer message.

## Extra

### Planned Additions
* Support for multiple sites.
* More data on each file.
* Option to ignore "non-important" files.

### Development

This is really easy to edit if you are proficient in NodeJS. I encourage any devs to make a fork and add any features they would like.
